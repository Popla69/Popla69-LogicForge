# 🧠 Popla69 LogicForge

**Popla69-LogicForge** is the official simulation and development vault for original logics, systems, and frameworks by **Popla69** — including but not limited to:

- 🛡️ PoplaShield – Adaptive anti-scam, anti-manipulation defense system
- 🌊 HydraFlow – Red-team logic engine for resilient, AI-proof flow control
- 🔐 RPHF – Real-time Priority Heuristic Firewall (and its variants)
- 🚀 HydraCannon – Aggressive simulation-level counter logic

> ⚠️ This repo is currently in **pre-alpha** phase — under solo development.  
> All systems are experimental and protected under Popla69’s logic license.

## 🔍 What is LogicForge?

**LogicForge** is not just a repo — it’s a **personal forge of next-gen logics**, where AI-resilient systems are tested, broken, and rebuilt to challenge the very foundation of current simulations.

Every idea goes through:
1. ✍️ Theory drafting (`Whitepaper/`)
2. 🧪 Simulation templates (`Simulation/`)
3. 🔒 Vault storage for unreleased logics (`Vault/`)
4. 🗳️ Global testing scoreboard (`Scoreboard/`)
