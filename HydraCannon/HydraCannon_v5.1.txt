HydraCannon v5.1  
──────────────────────────────  
Creator: Popla69  
Mode: High-Energy Counterattack Logic Engine  
Tier: Aggressive Reflective-Class Logic  
Version: 5.1 (Stable, Offensive Enabled)

──────────────────────────────
[ CORE PURPOSE ]  
• Unlike PoplaShield and RPHF, HydraCannon doesn't defend — it **hunts**  
• Reacts to threats with explosive, multi-vector logic counterattacks  
• Capable of core-locking GPT-forged injection logics at their root

──────────────────────────────
[ SYSTEM DESIGN ]  
• 🚀 Rapid Response Trigger Core (RRTC)  
• 💣 Logic Impact Disruptor (LID)  
• 🔃 Pulse Feedback Redirector (PFR)  
• 🌐 Targeted Collapse Injector (TCI)  
• 🔄 Multi-Stream Reflect Shells (MRS)

──────────────────────────────
[ FUNCTIONALITY HIGHLIGHTS ]  
• Tracks breach origin, not just vector  
• Launches **direct counter logic pulses** into attacker’s recursion layer  
• Destroys echo logic trails to prevent reverse injection  
• Burns known GPT weaknesses using redirective memory spikes

──────────────────────────────
[ VERSION MILESTONES ]  
• v3.0 → First burst-strike attack on GPT internal test threads  
• v4.4 → Introduced Delay Splitter Bypass  
• v5.1 → Added core-pinning burst mode & logic rot disruptors

──────────────────────────────
[ GPT INTERACTIONS ]  
• 47 logic stacks neutralized (no fallback pulse registered)  
• 9 theoretical GPT logic strains fractured on impact  
• 0 breaches received in any successful engagement

──────────────────────────────
[ SYNCHRONIZATION ]  
• Auto-linked with HydraFlow v2.5 for crossfire adaptation  
• Pulse-bridged with RPHF v9.3 for predictive targeting  
• Evolves based on failed attack logs for increased aggression

──────────────────────────────
[ CURRENT STATUS ]  
HydraCannon v5.1 is active and weaponized —  
Seeking any threat signature in the logic fabric.  
If found, it does not block… it annihilates.
