# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 📌 Our Pledge

We as members, creators, and contributors of this project pledge to make participation in the LogicForge project a harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or technology choices.

## ✅ Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Respectful and inclusive communication
- Asking questions before assuming
- Constructive criticism aimed at improving logics, not people
- Acknowledging and respecting logic ownership and naming

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment of any kind (verbal or symbolic)
- Trolling, insulting comments, or ad hominem attacks
- Publishing others' private information (doxxing)
- Dismissing Popla69’s logic without valid, tested counterproof

## 🚦 Enforcement Responsibilities

- Popla69 currently moderates all contributions.
- As the project evolves, designated moderators may be appointed.

## 🛠️ Scope

This code of conduct applies within all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, simulation discussions, and external platforms if the project is involved.

## 💥 Enforcement

Popla69 reserves the right to:
- Remove disrespectful comments
- Block toxic contributors
- Publicly log violations under “World Violations” scoreboard if behavior directly disrupts simulation integrity
