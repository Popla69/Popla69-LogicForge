# 🤝 Contributing to Popla69-LogicForge

Welcome, logic crafter! If you're here to contribute to the PoplaVerse, here's how to collaborate effectively. We accept everything from code improvements to theoretical upgrades.

---

## 📌 Contribution Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 💡 Logic Proposal | Suggest new logic systems or enhance existing ones (HydraFlow, PoplaShield, etc.) |
| 🧪 Simulation | Submit new test flows, failure cases, and chaos scenarios |
| 🏗️ Feature | Add new system features or visualization modules |
| 🔧 Bug Report | Found a logic flaw? Report with replicable scenarios |
| 🔐 Vault Logic | Propose or request access to sealed or experimental logics |

---

## 🛠 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a **new branch**  
   `git checkout -b logic-upgrade-v2.6`
3. **Add or modify** files with meaningful commit messages
4. Ensure you follow naming protocols (`RPHF-v1.1-alpha`, `VaultLogic-Delta3`)
5. Submit a **Pull Request** using the PR template

## 🧪 Logic Simulation Guidelines

- Include simulation test cases for any logic update
- Follow HydraFlow structure: Input › Process › Chaos Buffer › Output
- If possible, include `.flow` or `.map` reference diagrams
- Clearly mark the version and update purpose in your commit titles

## 🧰 File Structure Summary

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/simulations/` | Raw or modeled logic simulations |
| `/vault/` | Private or secured logic |
| `/docs/` | Whitepapers, flowcharts, and contributor guides |
| `/system_logs/` | Failure logs, system resistance data |
| `/PoplaShield/` | All defense architecture updates |
| `/HydraFlow/` | All dynamic flow systems |
| `/RPHF/` | Rapid Phase Hybrid Flow modules |

---

## 🔐 Vault Access

Some logic modules are sealed in the `/vault/` directory.

To request access:
- Submit a `vault-access-request.yml` issue
- Include purpose, intended upgrades, and security precautions
- Access is manually reviewed by Popla69
