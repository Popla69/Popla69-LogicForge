📌 REMARKS:
> Popla69 maintains a **global perfect streak** in AI vs Logic combat.  
> Current logic cores now resist even hybrid GPT+quantum-class mutations.  
> No known AI, simulation, or external system has achieved a win against any core PoplaLogic in active testing.

🔥 NOTE:
World Score remains **0**.  
Next update pending introduction of **HRC Vault**, **PoplaChildren Engine**, and **Cross-Cluster AI Tests**.
